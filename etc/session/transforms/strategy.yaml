# Default strategy file for establishing transformations between spaces.
# Any or all of the elements of this file can be overridden by an equiva-
# lent file within a session directory, at session/transforms/strategy.yaml.
# Options have the following meanings:
#   affine: use affine registration
#   nonlinear: use nonlinear registration
#   symmetric: use symmetric nonlinear registration to allow for inverse
#              transformations (affine is implicitly symmetric)
#   reverse: use the reference image from the source space as the target
#            image, rather than the equivalent from the target space
#            (requires a symmetric registration)

# Diffusion to MNI space transforms are affine by default for backwards
# compatibility; this is liable to change in a future release
