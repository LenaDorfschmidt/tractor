Calculate the age of a scan subject to the day, using information from a DICOM file. If no file is specified, the script will search the working directory for DICOM files, and use the first one it 
finds. BreakdownLevel should be set to 1 for years only (given as a real number); 2 for years and days; and 3 for years, months and days. BreakdownLevel is fixed to 1 if NumberOnly:true is given.
