  modularity}
\description{This function implements the multi-level modularity optimization
  algorithm for finding community structure, see references below. It
  is based on the modularity measure and a hierarchial approach.

\usage{
multilevel.community (graph, weights = NULL) 
}
\arguments{
  \item{graph}{The input graph.}
  \item{weights}{Optional positive weight vector.
    If the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then this is used
    by default. Supply \code{NA} here if the graph has a \code{weight}
    edge attribute, but you want to ignore it.}
}
\details{
  This function implements the multi-level modularity optimization
  algorithm for finding community structure, see 
  VD Blondel, J-L Guillaume, R Lambiotte and E Lefebvre: Fast unfolding of
  community hierarchies in large networks,
  \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:0803.0476}
  for the details.

  It is based on the modularity measure and a hierarchial approach. 
  Initially, each vertex is assigned to a community on its own. In every
  step, vertices are re-assigned to communities in a local, greedy way:
  each vertex is moved to the community with which it achieves the
  highest contribution to modularity. When no vertices can be
  reassigned, each community is considered a vertex on its own, and the
  process starts again with the merged communities. The process stops
  when there is only a single vertex left or when the modularity
  cannot be increased any more in a step.
